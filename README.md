### Howdy ðŸ¤ 

I'm a multiplatform (Swift/iOS & Android/Java) mobile app developer based in the Pacific Northwest of the United States. Since 2018, I've been the Senior Dev for UnderwaterAudio, LLC making mobile companion apps for their swim-ready music players and creating the software for their Android-powered Delphin player.

In my off-time, I'm studying to get a Master's degree in Mathematics and trying to rekindle the spark of hobbyist programming.
